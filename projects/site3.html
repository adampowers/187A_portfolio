As soon as FB's Timeline came out, I was very excited to play around with it. Here
was a brand new way of displaying personality on the world's largest social network.
</p>
<p>
After uploading several images and measuring the output in Photoshop, I quickly figured out
exactly how Facebook placed the Timeline cover photo in relation to the rest of the page.
Using that information, I was able to design a cover photo that to the untrained eye
(and perhaps even to the trained eye) appears to be a natural extension of Facebook's user interface.

<p>In this fashion, I've essentially upgraded my profile frames from 1 to 4, and created a neat
 visual effect to boot.</p>
