<p>I didn't make this site, but I really enjoy its aesthetic. I love how it manages
to be both bright and dark at the same time, catching your eye with color and switching
to a more muted scheme when it comes time to view code.
</p>
<p>Speaking of, I also really enjoy the syntax-highlighting in the code reader, to the
extent that I'm considering mimicking the style in my own IDE.</p>
